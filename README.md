A macOS text editor that has special functionality to represent the file tree as an animated graph of dependencies to better reflect how coding is often done.

This text editor also will support extensions that can create signals to the underlying app and accept new signals to create complex behavior that directly changes the state of the app.

A terminal will also be supported alongside advanced configuration potential for the creation of extra buttons and assigning scripts on button press. In such a way, along with the extension api, advanced behavior like debugging and running for any language can be theoretically supported as if it was native.

Advanced tools like CMake to compile C++ can also be automamated as such, and the debugger response can be mapped into signals to be represented on the main screen.
